# Job Search Data Analysis using SQL
## Introduction

ðŸ“Š Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data scientist roles, this project explores ðŸ’° top-paying jobs, ðŸ”¥ in-demand skills, and ðŸ“ˆ where high demand meets high salary in the Data Science field.

## Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

The data used for this project packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

**The first five queries below investigate the timing of job postings and the specific aspects about the data scientist job market:**
1. Which months have the highest amount of job postings?
2. How do the number of job postings vary throughout the day? (Focusing on the EST Zone in the United States)
3. What are the top ten in demand skills for data scientists (remote or New York roles)?
4. What are the most common skills for the top 100 highest-paying salaries (on average) Data Scientist roles that are located remotely or in New York?
5. Which companies had the most job postings for Data Scientist roles?


**In the last five queries below, the insight becomes visualized through Tableau on a beautiful dashboard.**
1. What are the most in-demand skills for each profession?
2. How many job postings were posted each month for each profession?
3. How many jobs were posted for each company for each profession?
4. How many job postings were posted in each country? Show the top 10 countries with the most job postings.
5. What is the average salary for each profession and senior profession?


## Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

* **SQL**: The programming language that allows me to query the database and reveal insights.<br>
* **PostgreSQL**: The database management system that handles the job posting data with over 750,000 unique job postings.<br>
* **Visual Studio Code**: The IDE used to connect to the PostgreSQL and execute SQL queries.<br>
* **Tableau Desktop & Tableau Public**: Enabled connection to the PostgreSQL database to provide beautiful visuals that further tell the story of the data.<br>
* **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.<br>


## The Analysis

### 1. Monthly Trends in Job Postings
Which months have the highest amount of job postings?<br>

This SQL query retrieves the number of job postings for each month from the `job_postings_fact` table. It uses the TO_CHAR function to extract the month from the `job_posted_date` 
column and then counts the occurrences of job postings (`job_id`) for each month. The results are grouped by the month and ordered in descending order of the number of job postings.

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(job_posted_date, 'Month') AS month,
    COUNT(job_id) as number_of_job_postings
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY number_of_job_postings DESC;
```
#### Results:
* **January** has the highest number of job postings, with 92,266.
* **August** and **October** also show high activity, with over 66,000 job postings each.
* The lowest number of job postings occurs in **May** with 52,235.<br>


| Month     | # of Job Postings |
|-----------|-------------------|
| January   | 92,266            |
| August    | 75,067            |
| October   | 66,601            |
| February  | 64,560            |
| November  | 64,404            |
| March     | 64,158            |
| July      | 63,855            |
| April     | 62,915            |
| September | 62,433            |
| June      | 61,500            |
| December  | 57,692            |
| May       | 52,235            |

#### Key Insights:
Overall, the best month to apply for jobs is January. This could be attributed to:
 * **New Year Hiring Plans**: Many companies reset their budgets and hiring plans at the start of the year. After the holiday season, organizations often start posting jobs for the upcoming year's projects and initiatives.
 * **End of Holiday Hiring Freeze**: Some companies slow down or freeze hiring during December due to the holiday season. Once the new year begins, they resume hiring, resulting in a surge in job postings.


### 2. Daily Variations in Job Postings
How do the number of job postings vary throughout the day? (Focusing on the EST Zone in the United States)<br>

This query analyzes job postings from the `job_postings_fact` table in the United States Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone. I create a CTE (`datetime_cte`) to convert `job_posted_date` to Eastern Standard Time (EST) and extract the time. I then use a `CASE` statement to classify job postings into distinct time periods, such as 'midnight', 'morning', 'afternoon', etc., based on the job posting time (`cte.time`). I filter the job postings based on specific Eastern U.S. states, and the results are grouped by `time_of_day` and ordered in ascending order.
```sql
WITH datetime_cte AS(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_posted_date,
        job_posted_date::date as date,
        (job_posted_date AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York')::timestamptz::TIME AS time
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE job_country = 'United States'
)

SELECT
    COUNT(j.job_id) as number_of_job_postings,
    CASE
        WHEN cte.time >= '00:00' AND cte.time < '03:00' THEN '1_midnight'
        WHEN cte.time >= '03:00' AND cte.time < '06:00' THEN '2_midnight/early-morning'
        WHEN cte.time >= '06:00' AND cte.time < '09:00' THEN '3_early-morning'
        WHEN cte.time >= '09:00' AND cte.time < '12:00' THEN '4_morning'
        WHEN cte.time >= '12:00' AND cte.time < '15:00' THEN '5_afternoon'
        WHEN cte.time >= '15:00' AND cte.time < '18:00' THEN '6_evening'
        WHEN cte.time >= '18:00' AND cte.time < '21:00' THEN '7_night'
        ELSE '8_late-night'
    END as time_of_day
FROM job_postings_fact as j
JOIN datetime_cte as cte USING (job_id)
WHERE job_location LIKE '%, ME%' OR job_location LIKE '%, MD%' OR job_location LIKE '%, MA%' OR job_location LIKE '%, NH%' OR job_location LIKE '%, NJ%' OR job_location LIKE '%, NY%' OR job_location LIKE '%, CT%' OR job_location LIKE '%, DE%' OR job_location LIKE '%, GA%' OR job_location LIKE '%, NC%' OR job_location LIKE '%, VT%' OR job_location LIKE '%, VA%' OR job_location LIKE '%, WV%' OR job_location LIKE '%, OH%' OR job_location LIKE '%, PA%' OR job_location LIKE '%, RI%' OR job_location LIKE '%, SC%' OR job_location LIKE '%, MI%' OR job_location LIKE '%, TN%' OR job_location LIKE '%, FL%' OR job_location LIKE '%, IN%' OR job_location LIKE '%, KY%'
GROUP BY time_of_day
ORDER BY time_of_day ASC;
```
#### Results:
* Job postings are heavily concentrated during traditional U.S. business hours, but there is still considerable activity in the early morning and evening periods.
* The night and late-night hours have the lowest job postings at 4,257 and 5,530, respectively, likely due to fewer recruiters working during these hours and reliance on automated systems.
* This analysis highlights job posting trends throughout the day, providing valuable insights for employers and job seekers in EST.

| # of Job Postings | Time of Day             |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 5530              | midnight                |
| 13542             | midnight/early-morning  |
| 13198             | early-morning           |
| 13004             | morning                 |
| 14607             | afternoon               |
| 11273             | evening                 |
| 12960             | night                   |
| 4257              | late-night              |


### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Scientists
What are the top ten in-demand skills for data scientists (remote or New York roles)?<br>

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 skills for Data Scientist roles in New York, NY, along with their average salaries. It counts job postings for each skill, filters for positions with salary data, and groups results by skill and skill type. The output is ordered by the number job postings and average salary, limiting results to the top 10 skills.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(j.job_id) AS skill_count,
    s.skills AS skill,
    ROUND(AVG(j.salary_year_avg),0) as average_salary_avg,
    s.type as skill_type
FROM job_postings_fact AS j
JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj USING (job_id)
JOIN skills_dim AS s USING (skill_id)
WHERE 
    profession = 'Data Scientist'
    AND j.job_location IN ('New York, NY')
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY s.skills, skill_type
ORDER BY skill_count DESC, average_salary_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
#### Results:
The most in-demand skills for Data Scientist roles in remote or New York locations are dominated by programming languages (Python, SQL, R) and machine learning libraries (pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Cloud skills like AWS and big data tools such as Spark are also highly valued, offering some of the highest salaries. Tools like Tableau and Excel are important but less in demand.

### 4.Common Skills Among High-Paying Data Scientist Roles
What are the most common skills for the top 100 highest-paying salaries (on average) Data Scientist roles that are located remotely or in New York?<br>

This SQL query identifies the top 100 highest-paying Data Scientist roles in the United States, specifically focusing on positions located in New York or labeled as 'Anywhere'. 

I first create the CTE `top_100_highest_paying` to retrieve the top 100 highest paying Data Scientist job postings. The main query then counts the number of job postings associated with each skill from the top 100 CTE. I join with the `skills_job_dim` and `skills_dim` tables to gather skills and their types, grouping the results by skill and skill type. The results are ordered by the number of job postings and limited to the top 5 skills.

```sql
WITH top_100_highest_paying AS(
    SELECT
        job_id as job_id,
        job_title as job_title,
        ROUND(salary_year_avg,0) as salary_avg,
        job_location
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        profession = 'Data Scientist'
        AND job_country = 'United States'
        AND (job_location = 'Anywhere' OR job_location LIKE '%NY%')
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_avg DESC
    LIMIT 100
)

SELECT
    COUNT(cte.job_id) as number_of_job_postings,
    s.skills as skill,
    s.type as skill_type
FROM top_100_highest_paying as cte
JOIN skills_job_dim USING (job_id)
JOIN skills_dim as s USING (skill_id)
GROUP BY skill, skill_type
ORDER BY number_of_job_postings DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
#### Results:
The top five most common skills are:<br>
| Skill   | % of Top 100 Jobs |
|:-------:|:-----------------:|
| Python  | 77%               |
| SQL     | 55%               |
| R**     | 35%               |
| Spark   | 22%               |
| Tableau | 16%               |


### 5. Leading Companies in Data Scientist Job Postings
Which companies had the most job postings for Data Scientist roles? <br>

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 companies that had the most amount of Data Scientist job postings for the year 2023. I joined the `job_postings_fact` table with the `company_dim` table using the `comapny_id` foreign key to obtain the companies' name.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.name as company,
    COUNT(j.job_id) as number_of_job_postings
FROM job_postings_fact as j
JOIN company_dim as c
USING (company_id)
WHERE profession = 'Data Scientist'
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY number_of_job_postings DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
